### What is this app?
This is a simple Shiny application created as part of the Developing Data Visualization course offered by the University of British Columbia

The app allows a user to explore violent crime statistics in the United State between 1995 - 2015 across various cities. The data used for building this app is from the [Marshal Project](https://github.com/themarshallproject/city-crime) which consists statistics about 4 major crimes i.e. homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault under the jurisdiction of various city departments.

### How do I use it?

Navigate through the app using the tabs at the top. Further detail and instruction are provided on each tab. A high level overview of what each does presented below:

* `Map`: Visualises the number of crimes between 1995-2015 by selecting the crime type based on geographic concentration of crimes. The added feature of `Show crime relative to Population` normalizes the crime numbers by the population of the city
* `Trends`: Shows the trend of all crimes between two cities based on the user selection of time period and cities
* `Data`: Compares the crime rates between two cities through raw statistics and user selections
